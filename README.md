The code you provided is a well-written foundation for a Python packet sniffer with a Tkinter GUI. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

Classes and Functions:

PacketSnifferApp: This class defines the main application logic.
init: Initializes the main window with title, text widget for displaying packets, and a button to start sniffing.
packet_callback: Processes captured packets and displays relevant information.
Checks for IP layer existence and extracts source/destination IP addresses and protocol.
Further checks for TCP/UDP layer and extracts port information if present.
Extracts payload data if the packet has a Raw layer.
Formats the information and inserts it with a separator line into the text widget.
start_sniffing: Starts packet sniffing using scapy.all.sniff with the defined callback function (packet_callback). Limits capture to 10 packets by default (count=10).
Main Application Flow:

Import libraries: tkinter for GUI and scapy.all for packet sniffing.
Create PacketSnifferApp Class: Define the application logic.
Main Window Setup:
Create a Tkinter root window with title "Packet Sniffer".
Instantiate a PacketSnifferApp class with the root window.
Start Tkinter Event Loop: root.mainloop() starts the GUI and waits for user interaction.
Improvements:

Stop Sniffing Button: You could add a button to stop the sniffing process.
Filter Packets: Allow filtering captured packets based on IP address or protocol using scapy.all.sniff filter parameter.
Clear Text: Add a button to clear the captured packet information from the text widget.
Packet Count: Display the number of captured packets.
Overall, this code provides a solid base for a user-friendly packet sniffer with a Tkinter interface. You can extend it further with additional functionalities based on your needs.

Important Note:

Remember that packet sniffing can be intrusive on a network. Ensure you have permission to capture traffic before running this program
